description = The Mark 15 torpedo, the standard American destroyer-launched torpedo of World War II, was developed by the Naval Torpedo Station Newport concurrently with the Mark 14 and was first deployed in 1938. It replaced the Mark 8 torpedo on surface ships with tubes that could accommodate the longer Mark 15.
