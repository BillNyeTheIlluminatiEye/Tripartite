manufacturer = Kerbin Navy
description = Fritz X was a German guided anti-ship glide bomb used during World War II. As one of the precursors of today's anti-ship missiles and precision-guided weapons, it was the world's first precision guided weapon ever deployed in combat, and the first to sink a ship in combat. (Laser guided)
