description = The Type 91 torpedo was an aerial torpedo of the Imperial Japanese Navy, designed to be launched from multiple types of airplanes, and was used in almost all carrier battles during Pacific War. This is the exact type used at Pearl Harbor, with wooden tail fins to keep horizontal in the air. (DO NOT DROP WHEN FLYING HIGHER THAN 80 M OR FASTER THAN 105 M/S)
