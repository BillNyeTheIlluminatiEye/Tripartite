description = A Kliment Voroshilov 1 turret. With its obscenely tough and thick armor it could survive a lot of hits. However the gun mounted on the turret was quite lackluster, its ZiS-5 gun did not do very well against armored targets. It uses standard CannonShell rounds. It did very well because 75% of the weight consisted of struts, and 1% boosters.
